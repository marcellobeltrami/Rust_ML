# LinearNN
An Implementation of Linear Algebra concepts and Machine Learning algorithms in Rust. 

`LinearNN` is a Rust crate that provides efficient linear algebra operations and a basic neural network framework. The crate is designed to be a building block for machine learning applications, offering key components such as matrices, vectors, and neural network layers.

## Features

- **Linear Algebra**: 
  - Matrix and vector operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, etc.)
  - Support for common linear algebra algorithms (LU decomposition, eigenvalues, etc.)
  - Efficient and memory-safe implementations using Rustâ€™s ownership model.
  - Supports data encoding and preprocessing from csv files.   

# To Do 
- **Neural Networks**:
  - Basic layers (Dense, ReLU, Sigmoid)
  - Feedforward neural networks
  - Backpropagation for training
  - Customizable activation functions
  - Integration with the linear algebra module for matrix operations.

- **Optimization Algorithms**:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Momentum-based optimizers (coming soon)
  - Learning rate schedulers (coming soon)

- **Serialization**:
  - Save and load models in common formats (JSON, binary)
